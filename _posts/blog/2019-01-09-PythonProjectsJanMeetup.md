## Boston Python User Group - January Project Night

This space is to show my Fall 2018 WPI Python-related programming projects. I worked in team sizes of 4 students (MS and Undergrad) to create presentable research projects on class topics. These team projects were for the courses in Machine Learning and Computer Vision. The following show each project followed by relevant information.

## Python & Machine Learning (ML)

This research project's focus was the development of robust image classifer models for geographically diverse image datasets, namely the Open Images V4 dataset.

You can read the publicly accessible online research paper here: [Link](https://cabincabin.github.io/MLRobustClassifier/)

## Python & Computer Vision (CV)

The problem statement that this project focused was: Does Computer Vision still play a role 
in the world of Artificial Intelligence?

This project involved using the Python library called OpenCV to perform a pretty straight forward comparitive analysis of the ML classification results of pre-processed images using traditional vision techniques.

Some example CV techniques included the following and mixture models:
- Blur
- Color Threshold
- Brightness Equalization

And the following is a visualization showing the results of the comparison study:
