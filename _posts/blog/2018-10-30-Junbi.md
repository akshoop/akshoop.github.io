This will be my easy-to-access notes for my interview preparations:

Coding Interview Prep work Github link: [Click Me](https://github.com/akshoop/CodeInterviewPrepRelated)

*insert checklist table here, where a list of Data Structures (Arrays, LinkedLists, HashMap, etc) and algorithms (Big O, sorting, trees, etc etc) are all listed with CHECK or not.*

**PYTHON**
- [What is it?](https://www.python.org/doc/essays/blurb/)
- [Certain Company's Style in using Python](https://github.com/google/styleguide/blob/gh-pages/pyguide.md)
    - Shebang Line. Most .py files will start with `#!/usr/bin/python`
    - Indent code blocks with 4 spaces.
    - Use parantheses sparingly. `if foo:` -> YES whereas `if (foo):` -> NO
    - For classes and methods, use docstring under the class or method name. Ie, `class SampleClass(object):` followed by `"""Summary of class here."""`. Or, `def fetch_rows(big_table):` followed by `"""Fetches rows from a BigTable."""`
    - Imports should be on separate lines. Ie, `import os` then `import sys` and NOT `import os, sys`
    - Never use spaces around the '=' sign when passing keyword arguments. Ie, `def complex(real, imag=0.0):` -> YES whereas `def complex(real, imag = 0.0):` -> NO
    - For function default values, use spaces around the = sign (but only for those arguments that have both an annotation and a default). Ie, `def func(a: int = 0) -> int:` -> YES wheras `def func(a: int=0) -> int:` -> NO
- [A Byte Of Python](https://python.swaroopch.com/)
    -  Python dictionaries are based on a well-tested and finely tuned hash table implementation that provides the performance characteristics you’d expect: O(1) time complexity for lookup, insert, update, and delete operations in the average case.
