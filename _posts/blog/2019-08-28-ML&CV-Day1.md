It's the beginning of my last graduate semester - Fall 2018 - at WPI. And after a long time of telling myself "wouldn't it be great to have a portfolio site/a platform to present my major work?" I finally got around to making a pretty good start! :thumbsup:

Welcome to Shoop's blog. I will first plan on using this portfolio website (created via Jekyll & Minimal Mistakes theme) to keep track of my notes and/or interesting learning experiences covering the following WPI courses:

- CS 539 Machine Learning (ML)
- CS 549 Computer Vision (CV)

*Disclaimer*: These are images/screenshots, random thoughts/notes, and some informal comments.

## Day1: ML (08/23/18)

The course for this Fall semester is taught by Professor Kyumin Lee. And I learned that the course website is [public](http://web.cs.wpi.edu/~kmlee/cs539), so that's nice.

to be cont.

## Day1: CV (08/27/18)

For this course, taught by Professor Michael Gennert, and the course contents are only accessible via the WPI Canvas page (so sadly, not public).
