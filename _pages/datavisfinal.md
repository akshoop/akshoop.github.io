For the CS 573 Data Visualization class final project, I worked with two Undergraduate students to create an interactive map of certified alcohol-serving venues in the city of Boston, MA. 

We wanted to present an exploratory view of "signal" around these venues. Our idea was that the more related tweets (such as posts about certain mixed drinks) that popped up near to a certain venue then one can assume that bar/restaurant was a popular spot. Our final result was a good prototype for our idea proposal.

We used the geographical data to retrieve tweets sent from locations near the venues. The tweets can be seen in a populated sidebar by interacting with the map.
